Hi, I am Jiasi Sun! I am a doctoral student in the Department of Energy, Environment, and Chemical Engineering at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I work in the [Environmental Biotechnology and Bioenergy Laboratory](https://ebbl.eece.wustl.edu/) directed by Professor [Jason He](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Zhen-Jason-He.html).

Previously, I obtained a master's degree from the University of Tokyo and a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering from Tianjin University.
